        I also currently have one dog, Pooh Bear, and he's a chow chow mix.-->

        So, yeah, my time at AMES honestly feels very short compared to Monticello.-->

      <h3>Why a Website?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Though I realize that a website may not be the best way to present about myself to an audience, I kind of got bored of slides after making dozens of them over the past 4 years.
        I also wanted to do something challenging for myself, as my ability would be the only thing limiting my presentation. Another plus about websites is that they are customizable and flexible
        to a certain extent. Finally, web developing was a possible career path that I had in mind.
      </p>
      <!--Why a website? Well, I asked myself this a lot while I was making it, but basically, I wanted to be creative and make something other than a slideshow
      because I have been making those for years and because websites have a little more flexibility in design and customization. But also, I could challenge myself and learn a lot from doing so.
      So actually working on it, I realized that designing a website to not look cheap and old was harder than I thought because
      I can't just put a title and bullet points for every page. There were times where I wanted to go back to slides and powerpoints, but I just stuck with it.-->
