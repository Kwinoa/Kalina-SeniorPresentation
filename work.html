        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>As the title states, this assignment was the final project for Painting II (and my favorite). The prompt was to paint anything you'd like, spend at least 2 hours, and use acrylic paint. I used a reference to paint this and took a good bit over 2 hours because I 
        got too absorbed in the process, and also because mixing the right colors was a challenge.
        </p>
        <!--I think this was the only painting where I really didn't have any complaints about, which was a good way to end the class.-->
    </div>

        <h3>White Rabbit</h3>
        <p>I painted this rabbit for a value painting. The assignment was to paint a black and white portrait in watercolor. I don't remember why I chose a rabbit, but I liked this painting
            because the black and white makes it so that you can focus on the details more, but also because painting in black and white is easier than color.
        </p>
        <!--Overall, I was pretty satisfied with this painting, especially the ears, which were the most detailed part. On the other hand, the whiskers were actually supposed to be white and they also look unnatural compared to the picture
        where it was thinner at the ends.-->

        <h3>Cherry Blossoms</h3>
        <p>I personally don't like this work, but I included it because others said they liked it and it was a good opportunity to critique it. Like the previous, the assignment for this was to use watercolor to paint a landscape (also using a reference). Starting with the positives,
            I think I got the proportions and placement down pretty well. On the other hand, it looks unnatural and the colors are off.
        </p>
        <!--You can mostly only tell if there was the reference next to it, but the whole painting is supposed to have a darker purple-ish hue to it because the sun is setting. With the texturing and details,
        I found that the whole painting looks too uniform, making it look unnatural and not very nature-like. And the clouds and reflection aren't blended very well.-->

        <h3>Chairs & Table</h3>
        <p>If I remember correctly, this was part of some Sketchup 3D design practice where we had to make four chairs and a table, each with unique textures and features. I included it because it was different from the paintings that I did in my art classes. They may look good on the outside and from this angle, but there are actually many imperfections
        in their design if you look underneath.

        <h3>Water Pollution</h3>
        <p>This was another final project for my world history class. If I remember correctly, my idea for the project was to connect the industrial revolution to water pollution. We were given free reign to do anything, and I chose to crochet because it didn't require me to look at a screen, so I could just mindlessly move my hands.
        </p>
        <!--So the left shows how industrialism and factories release sewage and contaminate water, and the right shows current practices that worsen the water quality, so accidents like oil spills and agricultural runoff.
        Both connect and contribute to water that is dangerous for living things. I think I was too ambitious while planning this project out and had to leave some details out.-->

        <h3>Two-Pager</h3>
        <p>I don't remember exactly what the prompt of this assignment was, but I'm guessing that we had to create a two-page infographic on some topic.
        My topic was probably to show how advancements in weaponry have contributed to deadlier wars. There's not much to say other than that my handwriting doesn't look that great.
        </p>
        <!--Or to WWII having significantly more casualties than the first world war.-->

<!--Anyways, I only showed a fraction of my work and the ones that I liked the most, but in reality, there are a lot more projects that didn't look that good that I didn't show, so its a little deceptive.-->
