        <h3>FOODS</h3>
        <p>I took Foods in my freshman and sophomore year for elective credits and just because it sounded fun. Some subjects that were taught in this class include reading
            nutrition labels, portioning food, roles of different ingredients in a recipe, substituting ingredients, 
            converting units, sanitary kitchen practices, important cooking terms, knife skills, and more. This class was useful because I learned some life skills and am more aware of 
            healthy sanitary and dietary habits.
        </p>
        <!--In-person in my freshman year and online in my sophomore year. Online was definitely more challenging because there were lots of times when I couldn't find or get access to an ingredient. 
            But i just had to be flexible and sometimes change things up. But cooking alone and personalizing my creations was still fun. Personally, I forgot most of this. 
            I just had fun cooking and baking, and my favorite activity was cinnamon rolls or just any bread or dessert.-->

        <h3>INTERNSHIP</h3>
        <p>Internship was a required class for juniors. The main activities and projects in this class were creating a resume and cover letter, practicing interview skills, 
            building a portfolio, and obviously completing the required internship hours. My internship was at an accounting firm, which started in the summer and lasted 2 weeks.
            This class was useful because I can use the materials in the future and because the internship was a valuable experience for me to explore career paths.
        </p>
        <!--It was more like a study period because there were few lessons and it took a whole year for me to find an internship, so I had nothing to do during class.
        I originally didn't plan on doing anything related to accounting, but i kind of ran out of options for internships and came up with whatever because accounting was at the top
        of career or college major lists and caught my eye. There, I basically transferred data to a new software, helped with payroll summaries and stubs, verified transactions
        and bank statements, and helped with bookkeeping. Yeah, but I met Austin, he's the office dog that kept me company.-->

        <h3>AP PSYCHOLOGY</h3>
        <p>I took AP psych for the college credit. Some things I learned were the different approaches to psychology, the important figures in psychology, nature vs. nurture,
            sensation and perception, developmental stages, experimentation ethics, the brain and body, stress and coping, bias, etc. This class was useful because it gave 
            me a college credit and helped me better understand human behavior.
        </p>
        <!--Starting the class, I definitely thought that we would just talk about like how to manipulate someone or about mental diseases, but there was a lot more to it,
        and a lot more science to it. Anyways, the class was pretty interesting overall, and I learned a lot more than I thought I would. 
        I hear a lot about psychology just being common sense, and some of it kind of is, but you also kind of have to know about things like who created this approach or like how the brain works-->

        <h3>AP US HISTORY</h3>
        <p>US History and the APUSH test was one of the most difficult classes for me because there was so much content to absorb and because I wasn't very fond of DBQ's or essays. Some topics I vaguely remember learning about were European colonization, Native American tribes, Manifest Destiny,
        Immigration, Industrialization, Reconstruction, and The Great Awakening. This class was useful because I gained a deeper understanding of the United States' history and how it contributed to the complex society we live in today.</p>
        <!--Studying for the APUSH test, I wasn't really sure how much I had to know or if I like just had to understand the general theme of that time period. But before this class, I thought that I kind of liked history and understood some of it,
        but taking it I thought differently and would often find myself asleep in the middle of a reading or assignment-->

        <h3>AP ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</h3>
        <p>The last AP class I took was environmental science this year. The class was fun because of the labs and activities. Among the many units we learned this year were biodiversity, populations, energy and resource consumption, cycles,
        and pollution. But the biggest takeaway from this class was sustainability and finding solutions to environmental problems.
        </p>
        <!--I found it interesting because it was a very relevant topic that that had a mix of other sciences like biology, chemistry, or whatever, and at least compared to most my other classes, I felt like the knowledge was something that would be useful outside of school.-->

        <h3>UOFU RACE AND GENDER</h3>
        <p>I took this class for a humanities college credit. I struggled a lot in this class for some reason, maybe because it was a more conceptual class and there was a lot of writing. But, some topics that was discussed in-class include marginality,
        feminism, oppressed vs oppressor, the model minority myth, intersectionality, colorism, and health inequalities. This was an important class because I think there are lots of relevant and important topics that was discussed in this class, and
        hearing other people's views and experiences helped me understand multiple perspectives. 
        </p>
        <!--And there were many instances where I wanted to withdraw from the class, but I didn't and I'm glad I didn't. Probably because it was a college class. Yeah but I'm glad I made it through the class.-->

        <h3>UOFU WRITING</h3>
        <p>UofU Writing was another class that I think I had a hard time in, but I have always struggled with writing, so it was a given that this class would be a challenge. Moving on from the negatives, 
        it was nice to be able to choose the topics of our paper and be flexible with the organization of it. The main assignments in this class were the collaborative writing assignment, personal research essay, monster essay, 
        rhetorical analysis, lit review, argument paper, and also the presentations. This class was still beneficial to me because we explored lots of genres of writing and because it prepares me for college writing.
        </p>
        <!--And it wasn't necessarily that the essays were long and difficult, but that there were a lot of times where I didn't know what to write or I was just not satisfied with my work or I didn't know how to pace myself. 
        Things like where to find good sources, how to format an essay, or how long of essays we should be expected to write.-->
