                I always wanted to know how long things are going to take or when someone is coming over. And so when something unexpected happened
                I'd feel helpless or I would spend the whole time worrying and thinking about how I would finish my homework. Basically I lack flexibility-->

            was me who was not bad at anything, but also not good at anything. So sometimes I would just be think that I can't take this class
            because I'm not as smart as the other students-->

            stop obsessing over this is procrastinating. Instead of always thinking that I'm not allowed to go out because I have unfinished work,
            I kind of just tell myself that this situation isn't ideal, but I'll get my homework done somehow, or that I can always do it another day.-->

                confident in my ability and just take whatever class and tell myself that I'll make it through somehow. So I guess I'm also more optimistic.-->
