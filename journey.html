            <p>At the start I kind of felt out of place and had many worries and anxieties...<br>- I was naively excited to leave the school I attended for 
            9 years<br>- I was under a lot of pressure to choose a major and plan out my career path early.
            <br>- I had low confidence in my ability to perform well in my classes.<br>- I genuinely doubted that I would graduate from high school.</p>
