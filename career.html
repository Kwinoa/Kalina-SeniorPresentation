            <h2>Q&A</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Q. Why did I choose the UofU?</h2>
            <p>A. Proximity, Everyone else goes there, It's well-known.</p>
            <!--I wasn't really planning on going out of state in the first place, so the University of Utah was kind of just the obvious choice for me due
            to it's proximity, the fact that everyone else in my family goes there too. It was also the college
            that I was the most familiar with and that I see and hear of everywhere, so it would be the first to come to mind when considering what college I
            wanted to go to.-->
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Q. What do I plan to study?</h2>
            <p>A. I'm not sure, but I know what I'm not good at.</p>
            <!--I don't really want to commit to a career or major too much right now because my choice could easily change, so I kind of want to be open 
            to most majors.The exception is anything relating to English and Writing because I have already established that it's not my strong-point, nor do I like it.
            But, the first thing that I would to try out and consider would probably be computer science, so I'll go from there.-->
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>Q. How has AMES prepared me for post-secondary education?</h2>
            <p>A. College credits, Setting expectations.</p>
            <!--Obviously the biggest contribution that AMES has given me are college credits that will get me ahead in terms of general ed class requirements, which would give me more time to explore careers and majors 
            without falling too behind. Next, AMES and the AP and UofU classes have given me a set of expectations concerning how rigorous the classes might be or how much writing and reading is
            expected of me in college. It's not perfect, but I feel reassured that I will be somewhat prepared for college courses. -->
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Q. What are my plans for housing and transportation?</h2>
            <p>A. Live with parents, Take the TRAX or carpool.</p>
            <!--Staying with my parents was the reasonable choice for me because it's less expensive, but also because it's not only like half an hour away. But for transportation, I'll just take the TRAX
            on most days, but I might carpool with my cousins or sometimes drive up there myself. I don't know my schedule yet, so I'm not sure.-->
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Q. What are my worries for college?</h2>
            <p>A. Career, Balancing school, Adjusting.</p>
            <!--My worries are mainly just figuring out what I want to do as a career and being passionate/motivated in what I do. And also being able to balance school with the rest
            of my life without becoming a shut-in or pulling all-nighters. And then I'm worried that I'll take long to adjust to college like I did for high school,
            or that I'll be too unfit to walk around campus. On the other hand, I feel like I have lots of support from my family, so I might be fine.-->
        </div>
        <!--Yeah, so that's it for my senior presentation, are there any questions?-->
